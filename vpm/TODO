Documentation

  - All declarations (control, build, location files) must be encoded in
    UTF-8
  - document provides, depends, and conflicts value formats (see
    _canonicalize_provides() and _canonicalize_relation() below)

FIXME: MISSING: signing or packages and signature verification
FIXME: MISSING: custom environments (formerly "environment descriptors")
FIXME: MISSING: advanced (circular, etc.) application of cartridge settings 
  e.g:
    - app A depends on cartridge B or C
    - A, B are installed
    - A's settings for B are applied to B
    - C is installed (does not conflict with B)
      -> A's settings for C should be applied
    - B is removed
      -> A should be "switched" from B to C right before removal
FIXME: MISSING: deployment mode support (rolling, "warm", "cold", etc.)
FIXME: MISSING: privilege separation between cartridges/packages, chroot'ing
FIXME: MISSING: hook security, runtime env. (incl. privilege separation)
  ? run hooks chroot'ed
FIXME: MISSING zip pathnames security validation


FIXME: check proper use of KEY_INSN, KEY_NAME, and KEY_NQUO

FIXME: support rollback in _remove
FIXME: stop on remove needs to recurse in dependent packages
