TODO

   * bring README documentation up to date
   * mark cartridge component as to be reloaded/restarted as necessary.
   * Support merging of scopes, groups, and items with existing scopes,
     e.g. two applications requesting conflicting settings for the
     (logically) same "Directory /path" scope.  Right now, two eponymous
     "Directory" scopes are created.
